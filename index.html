        <h4>Why Formulock?</h4>
        <h2>The Patent Pending Formulock System</h2>
        <p>Have you ever wondered why with all our modern conveniences, we are still forced to carry around a bulky set of keys? Some solutions to this problem have been found, but are either overly complicated, require experts to install and maintain, fail when the power goes out, or force you to carry around even more things. In addition, studies have shown that there is a strong reluctance to switch from away from trusted mechanical systems to digital ones.</p>
        <p>The Formulock system looks and functions exactly like a traditional tumbler lock, but can be programmed to accept any key, making it as convenient as a key-card, Bluetooth, or code lock system. In addition, it doesn't lock you out if it loses power, is simple to program, and can be maintained by any locksmith. The best part however is that it can dramatically cut down the amount of keys you are required to carry.</p>

        <h4>How it Works</h4>
        <h2>The Patent Pending Formulock System</h2>
        <p>The Formulock system uses a patent pending design which allows for distinct methods of operation between when the system is powered and when it is not. Switching between these two modes is automatic and seamless, and both modes utilize the same keyway.</p>
        
        <p>When powered, the Formulock can accept any key the user has programmed it to accept, all while looking and feeling indistinguishable from a standard lock. If power to the system is lost, the Formulock retains functionality as a traditional deadbolt lock. The system can be programmed via an available touchscreen, smartphone app, USB connection, or SD card.</p>
        
        <p>The Formulock is comparable in size and weight to a traditional deadbolt lock, and installs in the same, simple manner.</p>

        <div id="other-img"></div>
        <h4>Other Benefits</h4>
        <h2>Fully Modular</h2>
        <p>The Formulock system is designed to be fully modular, so that the electronic components can be easily disconnected and replaced while the remaining mechanical lock can be serviced by any trained locksmith. This helps support local business and ensure support for the Formulock can be found locally.</p>
        <h2>Fewer Keys</h2>
        <p>Owning a Formulock means never having to change your locks, cut extra keys, or hide guest keys outside your home. Access conditions for specific keys can also be set.</p>
